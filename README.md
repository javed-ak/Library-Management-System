# Library Management System

In this repo I'll try to make a library management system from where keep track of the total students/user of the library there joining date and when the membership going to expire, they got auto generated notification on their registered mobile number...


## Introduction

Purpose: This document outlines the design and implementation of a Library Management System to manage users, track memberships, and send notifications regarding membership expiration.
Scope: The system will allow administrators to manage user information, track their membership duration, and automate notifications for membership renewals.


## System Overview

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT or Passport.js
Notifications: Twilio or similar SMS API


## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User Registration: Users can register with their personal details and choose a membership plan.
- Membership Management: Track user memberships and expiration dates.
- Notifications: Automated SMS notifications for users when their membership is about to expire.
- Payment Tracking: Record and manage payments for different membership plans.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: The system should handle a growing number of users.
- Security: Ensure secure storage of user data and secure authentication mechanisms.
- Reliability: The system should send notifications on time and accurately track membership periods.


## Database Design

### Collections
Users (JavaScript):
      {
        name: String,
        contact: String,
        email: String,
        membershipType: String,
        startDate: Date,
        expirationDate: Date,
        notificationsSent: [Date]
      }

Membership Plans (JavaScript):
      {
        planName: String,
        duration: Number, // in days
        price: Number
      }

Payments (JavaScript):
      {
        userId: ObjectId,
        amountPaid: Number,
        paymentDate: Date,
        membershipType: String
      }


## System Design 

### Architecture

**Client-Server Architecture:** The frontend (React.js) communicates with the backend (Node.js) through RESTful APIs.
**Database:** MongoDB to store user data, membership details, and payment records.


## Future Enhancements
- **Online Payment Integration:** Allow users to pay for memberships directly through the system.
- **Reporting:** Implement advanced reporting features for administrators to analyze user activity and payments.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile app for users to manage their memberships on the go
